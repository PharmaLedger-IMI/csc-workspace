        <psk-chapter title="Serverless Choregraphies ">
            Under the concept of "Serverless Choregraphies" we propose a general model for running executable choreographies in a "choreography as a service" model.
            We use this model also fo execution of the blockchain transactions.

    <psk-chapter title="EDFS subproject">
        PrivateSky efforts to offer to create a database for storing private data conducted us to propose the  EDFS (Encrypted Distributed File System) that is both a file system and a blockchain based distributed database.
        The main purpose of EDFS is to serve as near-chain (off-chain) storage for blockchains.
        To properly understand EDFS capabilities we need to understand 4 concepts:  BAR archives,CSBs, Secret Smart Contracts, Self-Sovereign Applications.
        Our preliminary work on Self-Sovereignithy was published in two articles <i>“Private Data System enabling Self-Sovereign Storage managed by Executable Choreographies”</i>, DAIS 2017 - 17th IFIP International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems, Neuchâtel, Switzerland, June 2017 and
        <i>"Towards a smart society through personal assistants employing executable choreographies"</i>, ISD 2017, 6-8 Sep 2017 26th International Conference on Information Systems Development We are working to write an publish a new scientific articles on the concept of Self-Sovereign Applications. A short presentation of the concept can be found here:

        <psk-chapter title="BAR file format">
            A BAR is an archive format (to replace ZIP,TAR file formats) so is just a container for files. We believe that this approach could  replace ZIPs, TARs.
            In general,we believe that usual day to day file manipulation should disappear from the mind of users and this will be enabled by the vision for EDFS.
            All applications will be part of Digital Wallets supporting Self Sovereign Applications and forming together the EDFS.
        </psk-chapter>

        <psk-chapter title="Dossier concept">
            <ul>
                A Dossier is a BAR archive containing:
                <li> Data (as files and folders)</li>
                <li> An embedded ledger (a blockchain as  chained history of transaction grouped in blocks) </li>
                <li> Constitution (validation code, for example secret smart contracts) </li>
                <li> An embedded Web Application (code) </li>
            </ul>

        </psk-chapter>

        <psk-chapter title="Secret Smart Contracts">
            A set of related asset types and transactions types from the constitution of a Dossier  blockchain are called in PrivateSky with the term: Secret Smart Contracts.
            The first public presentation of the secret smart contract concept is published in the article: <i>Secret Smart Contracts in Hierarchical Blockchains</i>. In 28th International Conference on Information Systems Development (ISD2019), August 28-30,
            Toulon, France.
            <ol>
                Key differences compared with smart contracts:
                <li>
                    Their existence is visible only to a small group of users (because they are embedded in CSBs)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Executed in security contexts: automatically use the secret keys available to the current user (keys stored in CSBs)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verifiable only by a selected group
                </li>
            </ol>
        </psk-chapter>

        <psk-chapter title="Self-Sovereign Applications (SSApps)">
            Irrent form, Self-Sovereign Applications are implemented in way that is similar with Progressive Web Applications because Service Workers are used.
            <div>
                A Service Worker is essentially a JavaScript file that runs separately from the main browser thread, intercepting network requests, caching or retrieving resources from the cache, and delivering push messages.
            </div>

            We are talking about SSApp as about a Distributed Application (DApp) implemented with tehnologies for Web Applications and in such a way that all its code and data is stored in CSBs.
            The UI and "server" side part of the SSApp stays in CSBs. The execution of SSApp happens without distant servers (there is no external server doing any processing!) but a server is simulated using service workers.

        </psk-chapter>

        Hopefully, we understand now how EDFS is a nice  programming abstraction to make it easier to work with encrypted and distributed data.

    <psk-chapter title="PrivateSky for Integration projects ">
        PrivateSky's open-source platform allows the creation of backend or integration layers (like ESBs - Enterprise Service Buses) for cloud and enterprise application.
        PrivateSky offers a microservices oriented architecture where the microservices composability (orchestration and executable choreographies) is delegated to a "software glue"
        called swarms (or swarm communication).
        PrivateSky is also a platform to build decentralized/distributed applications that use blockchain: Distributed Applications - DApps, diverse types of Blockchain Applications,
        Consortium/Private Distributed Ledgers. The major innovations from PrivateSky are related to swarm communication (an improvement over Object Oriented Programming), blockchain
        and creation of performant methods of storing and handling private and confidential data.
        An important concern for PrivateSky is to create technologies that enable privacy and confidentiality by default. For a quick understanding of the swarm communication set
        we suggest our other articles.
